## Project Overview
Live Demo: https://ultimatestackdeveloper.netlify.com

**Ultimate Stack Developer** is an application for managing micro-scale blog about `whatever you can imagine!`

### Tech Stack
Backend part is based on:
- `Java 11` with `Spring Boot`

- `GraphQL` for managing API communication between the frontend and the backend

- `Docker` for easy application setup

## Key Files Description
`docker-compose.yml` - this file is used in order to spin up the application in a quick and easy way

`Dockerfile` - this file enables `docker-compose` to properly dockerize* the app

`pom.xml` - this file contains all the dependencies that are being used by the application (and basically everything for the building/testing/deploying automation with Java)

* *to dockerize* - to set up application on the so-called `container`, therefore being able to deploy it, without a
  hustle on any docker-engine based environment (to smooth this process a little more, it's common to deploy
  multiple containers together using the docker-compose library)

## API & CORS (Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing) Handling

Backend of the UltimateStackDeveloper app uses the CORS to secure API requests made by browsers and narrows it down
to `https://ultimatestackdevleoper.netlify.app` (disabled by default)

### CORS Security Toggle
Modify this line in order to remove/add CORS security `src/main/java/pl/tomaszbuga/ultimatestackdeveloper/config/JwtSecurityConfig.java:56` (`corsConfigurationSource()`)

## Getting started
Prerequisites
- Java 11 SDK (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
- Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Docker Desktop (including Docker CLI/Compose) (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Clone the repository & run the project
   - Launch `Terminal.app` and navigate (using `cd` command) to directory, where you'd like to store your copy of the source code
   - Use the `git clone https://github.com/catnippers/ultimate-stack-developer-backend.git` command to clone the repository to your local directory
   - Navigate (using `cd` command) to the root directory of the project (basically - it's where the `pom.xml` file is located)
   - Run the `docker-compose up` in order to run the application and database in the docker containers using the `Docker Engine`
